## Overview

The response amplitude operator (RAO) is a method that computes the response of a ship given a hydrodynamic dataset. The response is characterised by the six degrees of freedom (DOFs), which are pitch, roll, yaw, surge, sway, and heave. The rotational DOFs (pitch, roll, and yaw) are measured in radians, whereas the translational DOFs (surge, sway, and heave) are measured in meters.
